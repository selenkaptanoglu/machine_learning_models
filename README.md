# Machine Learning Models

<p>There are three types of Naive Bayes Classifiers in sklearn;Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>We use Bernoulli Naive Bayes when our data is binary like true or false, yes or no and so on. </li>
  <li>We use Multinomial Naive Bayes when we have discrete values such as pages in a book, number of family members</li>
  <li>We use Gaussian Naive Bayes when all of our features are continuous variables, like height or temperature</li>
</ul>
